# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited!

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/Bankole2000/logistics-api).

## Pull Requests

Here are some guidelines to make the process smoother:

- **Add a test** - New features and bugfixes need tests. If you find it difficult to test, please tell us in the pull request and we will try to help you!
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Run `npm test` locally** - This will allow you to go faster
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure your commits message means something
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
